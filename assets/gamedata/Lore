Overwhelmed by the stresses of city life and making deliveries--as well as horrible conditions in Cheerville, 
you, Duber McDonlad, have decided to move to the countryside and start a new life as a farmer in the quaint 
town of Stardube Valley. Have fun as you work to farm, fish, and mine, and explore the awesome world of 
Stardube Valley and interact with its interesting and *completely original* citizens!
